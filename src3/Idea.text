So I had an Idea since we dont so much have a matchmaking algorithm. Why not slightly pivot and create a place where people can create a resume and have links to their Github Linked In Live Pages kinda like a portfolio page users would not be looking at other users pages but we could also incorporate a job search api to display jobs in your area.
There is a second part designed for recruiters that let them look through the available candidates.
